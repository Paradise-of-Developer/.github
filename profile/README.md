## Management Chart
We support the triangular scheme. It aims to have more people in the lowest hierarchical roles in this schema. The lowest role is the Local Committee (LC) member role. (Example Title: LC Poland Member Aidan.) The next role is LC Board Member role. (Example Title: LC Turkey Board Member Evan.) Next comes the PD Member. In fact, not every member is a PD member. Only those who can reach a higher level after becoming an LC Board become PD Members. Finally, the Board member comes. (Ex: Board Member Magda or PD Board Member Magda etc.)

Board selections are left to the discretion of the Local Committees. Each LC must have a chairperson. For the General PD Board, our ministries are as follows; Presidency (CH), Foreign Affairs (FA), Internal Affairs (IA), R&D (RD), Database Administration (DA) and Hunters (H!). Ministries represent a Board. For example, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is the responsibility of a Board Member.
